# Gravity_Entropy

This repository hosts the Jupyter notebooks and supplementary materials for the research work:

**"Gravity as an Entropic Deficit Field"**  
by Renato Henriques.
Institute os Earth Sciences; Department of Earth Sciences, School of Sciences, University of Minho, Portugal. 

## Overview
The notebooks included here explore key simulations and analyses related to the entropic field framework (\Phi_s), covering:
- Mercury perihelion simulation (Newton vs Relativity vs Entropic Field),
- Solar magnetism and entropic magnetic cycles,
- Planetary magnetic field origins,
- Additional entropic field applications.
